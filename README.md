# Django - Test Driven Development
### A repository to follow the Obey The Testing Goat book and [website](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html#toc)

This is still a work in progress as I go through the whole book.

Current chapter: [Test Fixtures and a Decorator for Explicit Waits](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_fixtures_and_wait_decorator.html)
